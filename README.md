# CRUD - Spring Boot
This is a simple Spring Boot CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that demonstrates how to build a basic interface to interact with a database using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.

## Features
This project has functions to interact with multiple database entities in a MySQL Database. The entites have different relations to each other which are handled using Spring Data JPA mappings (@OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, & @ManyToMany).
- Create: Add new records to the database.
- Read: Retrieve existing records.
- Update: Modify existing records.
- Delete: Remove records from the database.
